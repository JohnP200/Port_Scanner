# Port Scanner (Python)

This is a simple TCP port scanner written in Python. It checks a list of common ports on a target IP address or hostname to see which ones are open.

## How It Works

- Uses Python's 'socket' module to connect to each port.
- Reports any ports that open.

## Usage 

Run it from the terminal

'''bash
python port_scanner.py
